**DESCRIPTION** :This project involves developing a Weather Web Application that allows users to search for weather information based on a city or their live location. The app also displays a 5-day weather forecast with daily temperatures and conditions. It fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

Key Features:
1. Current Weather Search: Users can enter a city name to get the current weather, including temperature, weather condition, and humidity.
2. Live Location Weather: By clicking a button, users can retrieve weather information based on their live location, using the device's geolocation feature.
3. Upcoming Weather Forecast: Displays a 5-day forecast showing daily temperatures and weather conditions for the next few days.
4. Responsive Design: The app is mobile-friendly, with a responsive layout that adapts to various screen sizes.
5. Navigation Bar: Provides quick access to sections like Search Weather, Live Location, and Upcoming Forecast.
6. The app uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive user interface. The weather data is retrieved using OpenWeatherMap API. JavaScript handles API requests, dynamically updates the webpage with weather information, and filters the forecast data to display weather conditions at 12:00 PM for the next five days.

This app serves as an effective and user-friendly tool for checking current and upcoming weather information, all in real-time.
